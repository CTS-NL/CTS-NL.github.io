![Alt](https://ctsnl.ca/Socials/qeii-meetup/qeii-meetup--Every%20Thursday-7pm.png "Meetup up every Thursday @ 7pm at Queen Elizabeth II Library.")

**tl;dr: We are now having our meetups on the third floor of the Queen Elizabeth II Library.**

This past December, after running our meetups out of Element Coffee Bar and Lounge for about three months, the location suddenly closed. We had hoped that the closure was temporary, but after some time it became apparent that the closure was permanent. We were again looking for a new location to hang out for a few hours every Thursday.

After some discussion on Slack, the decision was made to start meeting at the Queen Elizabeth II Library, as it has ample space, is open late, and a coffee shop on the first floor.

If you have any questions about the event, or the venue, please join our [Slack Group](https://join.slack.com/t/ctsnl/shared_invite/enQtNzE5Mzc1OTA3ODI2LTdhODg1ZTQ4YTMwNDRkYzI2OWZjOTZmYWZjNjA3N2QzMTRiZWEyNmI0MTRmYjNjMDFhZGUxNzlhY2I5YjEwMTk) or use our [Contact Us form](https://ctsnl.ca/contact/).

We look forward to meeting you in person!
