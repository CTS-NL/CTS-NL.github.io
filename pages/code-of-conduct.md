All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetups, in our Discord, and on our Facebook group are
required to agree with the following code of conduct. The executive members will enforce this code throughout all
our events, Facebook group and our Discord. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe
environment for everybody.

## Need Help?

Contact a member of the executive or organizer of any event. In Discord, the executive can be identified by the
role next to their names. The executive can also be reached by email at contact@ctsnl.ca.

## Purpose

We want to provide a forum for people who have an interest in software development, technology and computing to meet,
learn and discuss various topics of interest. We want people to feel safe and not have to worry about being insulted,
belittled or feeling dismissed as irrelevant.

We also realize that most people often do not intend to insult, belittle or be dismissive. So when we bring up undesired
behaviour that is making another member feel unwelcome, we expect the offender to stop.

## The Quick Version

This community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment in any
form including sexual language and imagery. If the executive members feel that you’ve violated the rules, we will remove
you from the event or forum.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in
public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the same anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images,
activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes,
or otherwise create a overly sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the CTS-NL Executive Members will take any action they deem appropriate,
including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup, event or online forum with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a
CTS-NL Executive Member immediately. Executive Members can be identified by the role next to their name and can be
identified to by any event organizer or volunteer.

The CTS-NL Executive Members will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the CTS-NL meetups
and events. We value your contributions and attendance.

This group is meant to be a positive place. While it is acceptable to vent a little, if that’s all you are offering, you
will be asked to leave.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all CTS-NL meetups, events, and in our online forums.

## Activation

If you wish to report violations of our code of conduct:

- Find a Executive Member, organizer, or volunteer
- Describe the incident to the best of your ability
- An Executive Member will approach the offender and inform them of the behaviour and ask them to stop, your anonymity
  will be respected

If the offender refuses to stop the behaviour or repeats it, they will be expelled immediately.

If the behaviour is judged too threatening, the offender may be expelled immediately at the discretion of the
Executive Members. Examples include but are not limited to: cat-calling and overt aggressive behaviour.

## Reminder

Please remember that the Executive Members, organizers, and especially our presenters are doing so by giving up their
free time. By being a positive and safe space, we will encourage more people to give their free time to help CTS-NL
continue to thrive.
