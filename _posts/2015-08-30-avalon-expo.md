So this year was the first year for a new local convention, Avalon Expo, and we teamed up with CodeNL and shared a table
to let more people know that we are here. We let people know who we are and what we wanna do to help this community
grow. We did this with our talks and with a slideshow. We also gave out cards with where they can find us on both social 
media and this website.
