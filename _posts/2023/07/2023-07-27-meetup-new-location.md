**tl;dr: We have returned to having our meetups at the Jumping Bean on Elizabeth Avenue.**

Primarily due to the early closing of the coffee shop at the Queen Elizabeth II Library during the summer hours, we have decided to return to the Jumping Bean location on Elizabeth Avenue. This location is not perfect, as it has less space than the QEII Library, and closes at 9 pm. However, after discussing with our members, the vast majority were in agreement that Jumping Bean was an overall better location.

For any students wishing to attend, Metrobus Route 2 is a direct route between the main campus and the Jumping Bean.

If you have any questions about the event, or the venue, please join our [Discord Server](http://discord.ctsnl.ca/) or use our [Contact Us form](https://ctsnl.ca/contact/).

We look forward to meeting you in person!
