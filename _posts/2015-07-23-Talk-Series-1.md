## Speaker

Whymarrh Whitby, a MUN Computer Science student and developer at Amec Foster Wheeler, will be giving the talk.

## Abstract

"Please test your software" â€” your users

My talk will cover what testing is and why it is important, as well as some of the benefits and trade-offs that surround
it. I will talk through what testing looks like in practice with a few examples and leave you with resources to continue
understanding the topic.
