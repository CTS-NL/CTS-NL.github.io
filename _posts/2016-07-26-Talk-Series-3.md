## Speaker
Mark is an architect on the Microsoft Azure engineering team, and lead of the Patterns and Practices group. He works
with customers building out the largest and most challenging applications and services on Azure, then turning those
experiences into best practices and guidance at [Microsoft patterns & practices](http://www.github.com/mspnp/). Prior
to joining Microsoft, Mark worked on a broad range of software project and platforms, from embedded digital design,
seismic visualization optimization, through live site operations for a SaaS platform.

## Abstract

From cars, to thermostats, through media players and embedded controllers, devices are being connected to the Internet
at a furious pace. To share information, publish telemetry, provide global visibility, or just to have someone to talk
to, backing services need to connect devices and information at a massive scale. This session will discuss and
demonstrate common anti-patterns and detailed examples from large scale customer deployments (1M+ devices),
illustrating the impact of engineering choices around concurrency in large-scale distributed systems.
