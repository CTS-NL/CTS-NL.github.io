## Tech Project Night and Meetup

Over the past year we have been holding a weekly tech project night and meetup at Jumping Bean Coffee on Elizabeth Ave.
The event is any opportunity for people to bring by their laptops, to work on your personal projects or to show off 
their work. Others attend to collaborate with peers, ask for help or chat about software development, programming and
technology. If you want to join us, we meet every Thursday from 7pm until closing. Checkout out or [meetup.com group][1]
for more information on our next event!
