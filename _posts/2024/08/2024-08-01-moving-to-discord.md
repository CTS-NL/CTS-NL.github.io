We've decided to move our main messaging platform from Slack to Discord!

Slack has done us well for quite a while, however in the time since the 2020 acquisition of Slack by Salesforce,
there have been some changes to the direction of Slack that haven't been great for this group.

Slack has been focusing more and more on its enterprise customers, and less and less on community-based groups
like ours.
We are now at almost 700 members (~150 active), and with a group that size, moderation tools become essential.
Slack has locked the majority of the moderation tools behind their paid version, and has greatly reduced our
ability to maintain this Slack organization. There have been only minimal features added to their free offerings.
We also have concerns that in the long term, Slack will start further limiting their free offering, and given
our size, we would definitely be caught up in those limits. We wouldn't be against paying for Slack to get
these features and more, but the cost would be outrageous unfortunately.

Discord, in comparison, has done a lot to support communities like ours. This includes strong moderation tools,
built-in automations, and a monetization plan that supports community groups. While Discord isn't perfect, and
we know there are impacts on some folks in the group, we strongly believe this is a move we need to make now,
before the decision is forced on us.

The Discord has already been active for sometime, with ever increasing waves of folks joining, and now has grown
to ~140 members. While this number is a 1/7th of Slacks _total_ numbers, its right on the dot for our active
user count in Slack, so I think it's safe to say it's already been a success.

We have no plans to shut down this Slack organization anytime soon, and we expect this migration to take some
time.

We welcome you to join us on Discord, if you're new to how the platform functions, don't fret to ask questions!
